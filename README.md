Hello, my name is Hyunjin-Noh.
I am a student of Ajou University.

I'm interesting in Artificial Intelligence for the person. Especially for analizing daily economical routine.
I will be an application(that uses AI) developer first, and afterwards, I will do brain research.

However, funny how, I'm now learning on computer science little by little.
Seniors, I'm looking for help with more practical knowledges.

Thank you, see you later.
